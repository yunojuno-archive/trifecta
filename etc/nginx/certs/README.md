# Nginx certs directory

This directory is mounted into the Nginx container, and available
to Nginx through the `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key`
properties:

```
server {
    listen 443;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl on;
    ssl_protocols       SSLv3 TLSv1;
    ssl_ciphers         HIGH:!ADH:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/certs/self_signed.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/self_signed.key;
    ...
}
```

The following bash script will create a self-signed certificate:

```bash
# create a new self-signed certificate for *.example.com
CERT_FILE_PATH="/vagrant/etc/nginx/self_signed"
echo "->  Creating SSL certificate files"
if [ ! -f $CERT_FILE_PATH.key ];
then
    openssl req \
        -new \
        -newkey rsa:2048 \
        -days 365 \
        -nodes \
        -x509 \
        -subj "/C=GB/ST=England/L=London/CN=*.example.com" \
        -keyout $CERT_FILE_PATH.key \
        -out $CERT_FILE_PATH.crt
    echo "<-  Certificate files created"
else
    echo "<-  Certificate files already exist"
fi
```

The `self_signed.cert` file generated should be added to your Certificate management program and then trusted. This will stop browsers (Chrome case in point) giving the Red Screen of Denial.

After the certificate generation has been completed, reboot the VM.

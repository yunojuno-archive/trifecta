# Trifecta

_(A trifecta is a a bet in which the person betting forecasts the first three finishers in a race in the correct order. This project has nothing to do with betting; it's a project in which using three things are put together in a specific order. My misuse of the word is understood and intentional. If you're a word-nerd, please forgive me.)_

This project contains the configuration required to run three separate technologies, in concert, to provide a consistent, repeatable, developer environment for Python (esp. Django) projects.

These three technologies are Vagrant, Docker, and Virtualenv.

The background to this project can be found on the YunoJuno tech blog in the following articles:

* Virtualenv (not yet published)
